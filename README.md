openscad
========

openSCAD designs I'm playing with.  Not guaranteed to work.

There are enough files here that I ought to make some sort of manifest/index to them, so here goes:

<dl>
<dt>heart_board.scad</dt>
<dt>inner_heart.dxf</dt>
<dt>outer_heart.dxf</dt>
<dd>This is a case designed to fit around the circuit described [here](https://github.com/rmd6502/charlie_heart).  Print 2, 
they should be symmetric enough to snap together.  I will create an Instructable in time for Valentine's Day.</dd>

<dt>FixturePlates.scad</dt>
<dt>red.dxf</dt>
<dt>green.dxf</dt>
<dt>blue.dxf</dt>
<dd>A WIP for a wall plate for my RGB hall lights, see [Github](https://github.com/rmd6502/hall_lights_connectport), and [Instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/Add-Wireless-lights-to-your-Home/).  The wall plate will contain three linear 
slide pots with 30mm travel, connected to a [Spark Core](http://spark.io), which will send instructions to the DigiConnect.</dd>

<dt>pinwheel.scad</dt>
<dd>An openscad design that makes surprisingly workable propellers.  Ultimately I'll design a fully 3d printable quadcopter,
but for now I put them loosely on the shaft of a motor and fling them at people.</dd>

<dd>The [Twitter](http://twitter.com) bird in various formats.  Follow me at [@rmd6502](http://twitter.com/rmd6502)!  Just send me a quick message that
you're human, I'm plagued by bots and may block you unintentionally.</dd>
