openscad
========

openSCAD designs I'm playing with.  Not guaranteed to work.

There are enough files here that I ought to make some sort of manifest/index to them, so here goes:

<dl>
<dt>heart_board.scad</dt>
<dt>inner_heart.dxf</dt>
<dt>outer_heart.dxf</dt>
<dd>This is a case designed to fit around the circuit described <a href="https://github.com/rmd6502/charlie_heart">here</a>.  Print 2, 
they should be symmetric enough to snap together.  I will create an Instructable in time for Valentine's Day.</dd>

<dt>FixturePlates.scad</dt>
<dt>red.dxf</dt>
<dt>green.dxf</dt>
<dt>blue.dxf</dt>
<dd>A WIP for a wall plate for my RGB hall lights, see 
<a href="https://github.com/rmd6502/hall_lights_connectport">Github</a> and 
<a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Add-Wireless-lights-to-your-Home/">Instructables</a>.  
The wall plate will contain three linear slide pots with 30mm travel, connected to a 
<a href="http://spark.io">Spark Core</a>, which will send instructions to the DigiConnect.</dd>

<dt>pinwheel.scad</dt>
<dd>An openscad design that makes surprisingly workable propellers.  Ultimately I'll design a fully 3d printable quadcopter,
but for now I put them loosely on the shaft of a motor and fling them at people.</dd>

<dd>The <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> bird in various formats.  
Follow me at <a href="http://twitter.com/rmd6502">@rmd6502</a>!  Just send me a quick message that
you're human, I'm plagued by bots and may block you unintentionally.</dd>
